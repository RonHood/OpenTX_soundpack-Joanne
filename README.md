# OpenTX_Soundpack-Joanne

Real recorded voice files for use with OpenTX 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.

To download the current soundpack go to the
[Releases page](https://github.com/pinkywafer/OpenTX_soundpack-Joanne/releases).
Make sure to select the download for your version of OpenTX.

To install, extract the contents of the zip file and move the en\ folder into your SD Card's SOUNDS folder.

The binary files on Github are currently arranged in OpenTX 2.2 format.
Download version folders are generated by the `Arrange.bat` batch file based on
the locations / filenames present in `contents.csv`. These folders are then
individually compressed to form the downloads.

A separate download for each supported version of OpenTX is available from the releases page (above).

If you wish to request additional sounds to be added for your own use, from your model names, to flight modes etc
or if you have any issues with the pack, you can make reports / requests at either:

* or by [opening an issue on Github](https://github.com/pinkywafer/OpenTX_soundpack-Joanne/issues).

This soundpack will remain permanently free, but a great deal of work has gone into it, and continues to do so.
